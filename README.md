# Fork Notice

This is a fork. The original repo I got my copy from 404'd, and so I have reuploaded it here. I will work to improve some aspects of this project over time where I can. Feel free to submit PRs and issues if you want.

# Browse 4chan completely in ~~parenthesis~~ Emacs Lisp.

**REQUIRES EMACS 25**

~~I am no longer developing this package. It's a fully functional browser but lacks a few features I initially planned because I decided not to waste any more time browsing chans then neccesary :^)~~


In this fork I plan on implementing features that I think are important for any 4chan client.
This is mainly actually being able to post on 4chan, and not just being a read only pleb.
To accomplish this I'll probably use the xwidget features.
After that, added features from 4chanx will be natural conclusion.

A few bullet points:
  * Uses the JSON api, no web scraping pleb shit.
  * No third party emacs dependencies, just a recent build of GNU Emacs (25+).
  * Full thumbnail support
  * Full resolution media support with the 3rd party programs `feh` and `mpv`
  * `wget` integration to download thread photos
  * Comfy navigation features like quote-hopping, URL scraping, viewing replies, and inline quote expansion.
  * Board, thread, and post crosslink support.
  * Send threads and post numbers to your native browser for easy replying
  * Integrates with Evil, Helm, and Ivy when they are available.

### Feedback and bug reports
You can file github issues for any reason you'd like. They don't have to be bug reports, they can be suggestions, complaints, etc. New feature requests are very welcome. I want to never have to touch firefox again to browse the 'chans.

### Default Keybinds
If you use evil, these are mostly the same except j/k replace n/p, page refreshing is done with R instead of g, and SPC/DEL is RET/DEL, and l to recenter is not bound to anything right now. Check the source for definitive definitions. As is always the case with emacs, these can be changed.
